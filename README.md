# notion-teleprompter
Turn Notion articles into a teleprompter-friendly script.

## Setup

### 1. Export from Notion
Select HTML and include subpages.

### 2. Unarchive and put into the `notion-teleprompter` folder.
Keeping many exports in the `notion-teleprompter` simultaneously is also supported.

### 3. Run `./PATCH.sh`

### 4. The teleprompter-friendly script is ready! Now publish it online or run locally.
Here, I use [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) as an example.

## Using the hardware teleprompter

Open your generated script in the browser (in my case [https://my-teleprompter-script.surge.sh](https://my-teleprompter-script.surge.sh)) on any device that fits your teleprompter.

It could be a tablet.

Or even a laptop.

Then remotely scroll the script

* either via [Bluetooth remote](https://www.google.com/search?q=ipad+bluetooth+remote) (or similar devices)
* or via [Switch Control](control ipad remotely from mac) (or alternative apps)
